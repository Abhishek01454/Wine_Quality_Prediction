# Wine Quality Prediction ML Model

## Overview

Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction ML Model repository! This project is designed to help you predict the quality of wines based on various features. Whether you're a winemaker, wine enthusiast, or just curious about the world of wine, this model can assist you in evaluating wine quality.

## Dataset

The core of this project is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Abhishek0145/Wine_Quality_prediction/tree/main). This dataset contains a wealth of information about wine samples, including attributes like acidity, alcohol content, and more, along with quality ratings.

## Model

Our machine learning model, built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy, aims to make accurate predictions about wine quality. We've chosen the Random Forest, ADA Boost, Bagging Classifier and other algorithms for this task. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on another portion to ensure its performance.

## Usage

To utilize this model for wine quality prediction, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   - **GitHub Desktop** (GUI):

     - Download and install GitHub Desktop from the official website.
     - Sign in with your GitHub account.
     - Click on the "Clone a Repository" button.

     - Choose the local directory where you want to save the repository.
     - Click "Clone" to download the repository to your computer.

   - **Command Line** (Git CLI):

     - Open your terminal or command prompt.
     - Run the following command to clone the repository:

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Abhishek0145/Wine_Quality_prediction/blob/main/Wine%20Prediction%20Model%20using%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```


4. **Run the Model**:

Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the model:

   ```
  python wine_quality_prediction.py
   ```

4. **Get Predictions**:

Provide input data with wine attributes to get predictions on wine quality.

## Results

The model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, can be found in the notebook or script's output. These metrics will help you assess how well the model predicts wine quality.

## Future Improvements

To enhance the model's performance, consider these future improvements:

- Collect more data for training.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters.
- Perform feature engineering to include additional relevant attributes.
